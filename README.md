# React Practice
Another project to practice some key React features.

## Technologies
Project was build with:
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
* [CSS Module](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

## Challenges
In this project I wanted to use my first custom hook. The hook is used to send requests and handle the potential erros. To solve the problem of repeting the same className I used CSS Modules.
